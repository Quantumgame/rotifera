# Rotifera

Rotifera bunddles two frameworks:
- *base* contains utilities to communicate with the robot. It is meant to run on a distant computer.
- *robot* contains the arbiter's files, the arduino's firmware and a python framework to build custom behaviors. It is meant to run on the embedded computer.
